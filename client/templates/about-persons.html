      <p>Ineke is the founder of Girl Code. With a Masters in New Media and a background in Gender Studies, she has always been fascinated by both code and equality. With Girl Code she can combine both.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://inekescheffers.com">I think the world of code is unnecessarily divided. And because I feel knowing how to code gives you superpowers, I think more women should be learning and doing it.</blockquote>
      <p>Because she doesn't only wants to write about tech and code anymore, but build it herself, she is putting her money where her mouth is and starts the Full-Stack Web Development with JavaScript course by NYCDA at BSSA in September.</p>

      <p>Katja is a founder of GirlCode. Being a web developer who made a shift from studying and teaching human languages, she believes there is a huge gender gap in programming professions. It must be bridged by inspiring more women to join this profession.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://netherlands.girlsintech.org/2015/07/08/junes-girl-of-the-month-katja-hollaar/">
        It must become less obvious that girls choose the humanities over mathematics, and vice versa.
      </blockquote>
      <p>By giving talks, organizing events, and mentoring others, Katja hopes to raise awareness of the often unsconsious predisposition of women not to choose a living in a male dominated industry.</p>
